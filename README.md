# Psychic-Game

OVERVIEW 
This is a letter guessing game that compares a user's choice of letter with a randomized letter selection by the computer. If the user guesses correctly they win, if the user gueeses incorrectly they loose. The user is given 9 guesses. After the user wins OR they guess incorrectly 9 times, the available guesses is reset to zero. 
The game score is kept then updated and displayed in the browser.  The score displays number of wins, losses, the user's guess, and the number of guesses remaining. 

BUILDING THE GAME
I referenced a Rock Paper Sciccors "rps" game we built as a class project for structure (link to my finished rps game below) and modified the if/else statements and variables to reflect the game differences. 

One of the first things that was fun to learn was how to create an array of all the letters of the alphabet without typing each letter out "a", - I was happy to find there was a way to do this with one string on code (reference below).

I chose to first focus on game functionality. Once the game is working exactly how I want, I will add a style sheet. 

Most of the game I was able to adjust to reflect the needed parameters. The elements that are proving challenging are below.

CHALLENGES
* I am having trouble resetting the guesses after the user guesses incorrectly 9 times.
* I am also having trouble displaying all 9 of the user's guesses. Right now I can only display one user guess at a time.
* I will be asking my tutor for help on these two facets.
